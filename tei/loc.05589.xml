        <note type="project" target="#dat1">As Floyd Stovall has noted, the few datable references in this notebook (e.g., the fighting at Sebastopol during the Crimean War) are to events from about 1853 to late 1854, shortly before the first publication of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. See Floyd Stovall, "Dating Whitman's Early Notebooks," <hi rend="italic">Studies in Bibliography</hi> 24 (1971), 197&#8211;204. See also Edward Grier, <hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi> (New York: New York University Press, 1984), 1:138&#8211;155.
          <lb/><lb/>This notebook contains much draft material for Whitman's early poems, although this fact has not often been recognized by scholars. Both Stovall and Grier point out that most of the connections to printed works are to poems and prose published in the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> but that the notebook also contains material clearly related to things that were first printed in the second (1856) and third (1860&#8211;1861) editions.
          <lb/><lb/>Whitman revised the text on leaf 23 verso to include a rather long passage that exceeded the space available between existing lines of text and therefore overflowed onto the facing page (leaf 24 recto).

         <p>It is a terrible sign of the human soul that it will not own any limit, even the
            widest.&#8212;The moment we knew the diameter of the earth to be eight thousand miles,
            it became no great thing to us.&#8212;With all the appalling grandeur of astronomy, if
            we could fix the line beyond which there was no more material universe, our soul, I
            think, would pine away and begin its death sickness</p>

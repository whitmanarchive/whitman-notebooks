	<note type="project" target="#dat1">Whitman likely wrote the building specifications on what is presented here as the last page of this notebook first, and then flipped the notebook over and wrote notes from the other direction. References to the <hi rend="italic">San Francisco</hi> can be dated to sometime after January 1854. The cover of the notebook is labeled "Note Book Walt Whitman" in a hand that is not Whitman's. Selections from this notebook were used in the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. See Edward Grier, <hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi> (New York: New York University Press, 1984), 1:113&#8211;117.</note>

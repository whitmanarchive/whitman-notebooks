	<note type="project" target="#dat1">These pages were written by Whitman in the early to mid-1850s. William White described the pages as "torn from a tall notebook" (<hi rend="italic">Daybooks and Notebooks</hi> [New York: New York University Press, 1978], 773&#8211;777). White noted a relationship between these pages and the poems "Who Learns My Lesson Complete?," "By Blue Ontario's Shore," "Song of the Answerer," and "There Was a Child Went Forth." Some of the ideas and language being worked out here also appear in the poem that would be titled "Song of Myself." For a discussion of the dating and importance of this notebook, see Matt Miller, <hi rend="italic">Collage of Myself: Walt Whitman and the Making of</hi> Leaves of Grass (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2010), 11&#8211;16.</note>

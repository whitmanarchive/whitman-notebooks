<add place="marginright" hand="unk" type="pasteon">
The London correspondent of the Dumfries 
Standard writes: "I am very sorry to inform 
you that the condition of Mr. Thomas Carlyle 
is giving a great deal of un<gap reason="illegible"/> to his 
friends.  He has long been known to be 
unhappy, although, when in the mood, he is 
the most delightful company imaginable.  Still 
it is not often that he is in the mood, and then 
with his bitterness and fierce sarcasm he makes 
it bad times for those who are beside him.  Of 
late, too, his gloom, moodiness, desire for 
seq<gap reason="illegible"/>, and irritability when disturbed 
have much increased.  Friend after friend, 
who had <gap reason="illegible"/> with him long out of respect 
for his real nobility of soul, have been <orig reg="gradually">gradu-</orig> 
ally alientaed by his capricious temper, and 
now the grand old man may be said to be 
almost alone in the world with his old Scotch 
servant from the hill-country of Dumfriesshire. 
Mr. Ruskin was the longest sufferer; but he, 
too, knows no longer the way to Cheyne Row. 
I heard the other day a story of Carlyle.  An 
American author of eminence came over <orig reg="bearing">bear-</orig> 
ing a letter of introduction from Emerson, one 
of Carlyle's special favorites and warmest <orig reg="admirers">ad-</orig> 
mirers.  Carlyle has a habit of answering his 
door himself, a practice rather disconcerting, I 
should say, to hawkers, beggars, &#38;c., and <orig reg="indeed">in-</orig> 
deed to applicants of another stamp. This 
particular Yankee knocked and Carlyle opened 
unto him. The man, taken aback, for he 
knew Carlyle well by his photographs (as who 
does not?), asked hesitatingly, "is Mr. Thomas 
Carlyle at home?"  The sage's reply was a 
loud and emphatic "No," followed by slamming 
the door with so much abruption that the 
American's nose made a very narrow escape. 
He has a large room at the top of the house, 
lighted from the roof, where all his favorite 
books are, and pasted on the walls are portraits
&#8212;some fine, others very common&#8212;of those 
whom he regarded as his heroes&#8212;Frederick 
the Great, Gustavus Adolphus, and a number 
more. This room is his sanctura, and few 
there be who are admitted into it; I have 
never known more than two&#8212;besides his <orig reg="secretaries">sec-</orig> 
retaries, whom he was wont to change very 
often, and to whom he did not always behave, 
it was said, so considerately as he might. There 
is something peculiar in the tenure of Mr. 
Carlyle's holding of his home in Cheyne 
Walk. He has not the remotest conception 
who is his landlord. He saw the <orig reg="advertisement">advertise-</orig> 
ment of the house to let, with directions to 
communicate with Messrs. Coatts and Co., wrote 
and received a reply accepting his offer, and 
directing that he should annually pay in his 
rent&#8212;if convenient&#8212;to Coatts and Co., "<orig reg="account">ac-</orig> 
count Cheyne Walk." Further, the rent is 
so low (<gap reason="illegible"/>) as to induce the idea that the 
arrangement sprung from a desire to <orig reg="accomplish">accom-</orig> 
modate the great author rather than to profit 
by him as a tenant."  March. 1870

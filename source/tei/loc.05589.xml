        <note type="project" target="#dat1">As Floyd Stovall has noted, the few datable references in this notebook (e.g., the fighting at Sebastopol during the Crimean War) are to events from about 1853 to late 1854, shortly before the first publication of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>. See Floyd Stovall, "Dating Whitman's Early Notebooks," <hi rend="italic">Studies in Bibliography</hi> 24 (1971), 197–204. See also Edward Grier, <hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi> (New York: New York University Press, 1984), 1:138–155. Whitman's notes about Egypt and mention of "Dr. Abbott" in the notebook probably also date to around 1854: Stovall writes that at this time "Whitman made frequent visits to the Egyptian Museum, which was established by Dr. Henry Abbott in New York" (202). Whitman discussed Abbott's museum at some length in the article "One of the Lessons Bordering Broadway: The Egyptian Museum," published in <hi rend="italic">Life Illustrated</hi> on December 8, 1855. 
          <lb/><lb/>This notebook contains much draft material for Whitman's early poems, although this fact has not often been recognized by scholars. Both Stovall and Grier point out that most of the connections to printed works are to poems and prose published in the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> but that the notebook also contains material clearly related to things that were first printed in the second (1856) and third (1860–1861) editions.
          <lb/><lb/>Whitman revised the text on leaf 23 verso to include a rather long passage that exceeded the space available between existing lines of text and therefore overflowed onto the facing page (leaf 24 recto).

              <note type="project" target="#rel01 #rel02 #rel03">At some point Whitman clipped out portions of two pages in this notebook (leaves 2 and 3 as represented here) and pasted them onto a larger sheet. It is possible that the writing on the clipped-out portion of leaf 3 verso, which would have been the only vertically oriented text in the notebook, was added after the page was removed. Because it is not entirely clear what text was added when, we have not included images or transcriptions of the clipped-out pages as part of this notebook transcription. However, we have made <ref target="../loc.05589/images_short/index.html">composite images</ref> that show the continuation of the text on both leaves, and the manuscripts have been transcribed in separate files.</note>

    <p>Edward Grier has noted that the phrase "drivers of horses," which appears twice in these lines, indicates a possible connection between these lines and the first poem of the 1855 edition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass,</hi> which was later titled "Song of Myself." In that poem, "drivers of horses" are named as one of various sorts of manual laborers about whom the narrator says, "I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out." See Grier, <hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi> (New York: New York University Press, 1984), 1:144.</p>

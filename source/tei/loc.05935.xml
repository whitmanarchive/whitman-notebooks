                <note type="project" target="#dat1">Scholars have offered a variety of opinions regarding the date of this notebook's composition. Andrew C. Higgins notes that the latest biographical information is for 1848 and judges this to be "the earliest of the major pre-<hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi> notebooks," probably used by Whitman "over a period of several years, beginning in the late 1840s." Higgins sees the racialized language and "the immature style of the poetry" as further support for an early date. Emory Holloway, in concluding that Whitman wrote the entries in "the period before 1855," focuses on a reference to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850. However, as the controversy surrounding the return of fugitive slaves was current for many years before and after 1854, this reference alone does not provide definitive evidence for a particular date. Edward F. Grier believes "the winter of 1855–1856" to be the most likely date for the notebook, though "some of the contents baffle any theory of WW's development." See Higgins, "Wage Slavery and the Composition of <hi rend="italic">Leaves of Grass</hi>: The 'Talbot Wilson' Notebook," <hi rend="italic">Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</hi> 20:2 (Fall 2002), 53–77; Holloway 86; and Grier 209.<lb/><lb/>
 Ed Folsom has noted that this notebook contains Whitman's "earliest draft" of the "mash'd fireman" passage of "Song of Myself," which would suggest that at least some of the notebook dates to about 1854. See Folsom, "Erasing Race: The Lost Black Presence in Whitman's Manuscripts," in <hi rend="italic">Whitman Noir: Black America and the Good Gray Poet</hi> (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2014), 3–31.
<lb/><lb/>The original notebook is one of several that were lost during World War II, and its current whereabouts are unknown. </note>

Grier, <hi rend="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</hi> (New York: New York University Press, 1984), 1:209–221. <lb/><lb/>The photostats, though obviously incomplete, prove that Holloway took considerable liberties, omitting much material from his transcription, which also ignores pagination and silently reorders parts of the text. Furthermore, because Holloway offers no description of or rationale for his editorial interventions, it is impossible to know the text's original order or how much of it is not represented by either his transcription or the photostats. For these reasons, our transcription, which follows the order offered by Grier, omits the usual references to page breaks.
